# Tailwind CSS @apply Directive Error Handling within Custom Directives

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using Tailwind CSS's `@apply` directive within a custom directive.  The error occurs when the parent element doesn't have all the classes required by the `@apply` directive.

## Problem

The `@apply` directive injects CSS utility classes.  If the target element or its parent lacks specific classes that are necessary for the `@apply` rule, Tailwind or the browser might throw an error, result in unexpected styling, or render nothing.

## Solution

The solution involves robust error handling and ensuring that all necessary utility classes are present on the target element or its parent before applying the custom directive. The code example in this repository shows how to check for necessary classes before applying the `@apply` directive, preventing potential errors.
